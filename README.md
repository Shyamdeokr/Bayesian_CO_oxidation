# Microkinetic Model
> This python code simulates the Pd site dynamics on CeO<sub>2</sub>(100) under lean CO oxidation, TOF for CO oxidation, Reaction orders in CO and O<sub>2</sub> as well as the rate limiting step and the coverage of the intermediate species under reaction conditions of the following extensive reaction network.
