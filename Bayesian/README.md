MKM.py - original MKM model for the given reaction network
MKM-corrected.py - Corrections to the energetics for the elementary steps of the reaction network
Bayesian.py - Bayesian corrected DFT energetics (interacts with MKM and MKM-corrected). Needs DFT energetics, T, P and experimental reaction orders in CO and O2 as inputs and outputs Bayesian correted energetics that match experimental data
